Serpents and spiders, tail of a rat, call in the spirits, wherever they're at!

Rap on a table - it's time to respond. Send us a message from somewhere beyond...

Goblins and ghoulies from last Halloween, awaken the spirits with your tambourine!

Creepies and crawlies, toads in a pond, let there be music from regions beyond!
